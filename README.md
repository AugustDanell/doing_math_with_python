The book Doing Math With Python looks to unify science, maths and Python. The book contains valuable exercises and is scalable, in that, it starts with easy exercises and then works upwards in terms of complexity. Python is overall a very useful language for math, and so, in this repo I am exploring Python maths within the confines of this book. The exercises are easy but interesting, I find :)

## Chapters
Chapter 1 one is just basic, normal arithmetic. 

In Chapter 2 the author introduces the use of the famous library pyplot and some fun exercises pertaining to just that, for instance plotting the temperature differance of different cities in the world as we look throughout a day. 

Chapter 3 pertains to statistics, finding standard deviation and variance etc. 

In chapter 4 we are using SymPy for different mathematical ends, solving equations, factorizations etc.

Chapter 5 is all about sets and probabilities. We learn of how to use intersections, unions, check if a set is a superset or subset of another etc. 

Chapter 6. TODO

Chapter 7 is all about calculus, using sympy to calculate limits, derivatives, solving maximization/minimization problems and more.
