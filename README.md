# Doing math with Python
Exercises from the book: Doing Math With Python, by Amit Saha. 

The book Doing Math With Python looks to unify science, maths and Python. The book contains valuable exercises and is scalable, in that, it starts with easy exercises and then works upwards in terms of complexity. Python is overall a very useful language for math, and so, in this repo I am exploring Python maths within the confines of this book.
